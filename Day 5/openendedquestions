Q1:
 
 single quotes: carries text only, with no expansions of variables or commands 
 double quotes: carries the text but allows the expansion of variables and commands
 
 Q2:
 
 -f: returns true if the file exists and a regular file 
 -d: returns true if the path exists and a directory
 
 Q3:
 
stdout: standard output: file descriptor 1 which gives normal program output
stderr:standard error: file descriptor 2 which shows error messages

Redirection: 
> overwrites : create new or clear the file before writing 
>> append : add the output to the end of the file 
&> : redirect both stdout and stderr

Confirm with File Descriptors

- finding the pid of the process
- checking the file descriptors 

Q4:
example:
╭─omar@omar-VirtualBox ~  
╰─➤  for i in 1 2 3 4 5; do
  echo "no. $i"      
done
no. 1
no. 2
no. 3
no. 4
no. 5

calculator:

╭─omar@omar-VirtualBox ~  
╰─➤  echo "1st no.: "           
read num1

echo "2nd no.: "            
read num2

echo "+ or -"    
read op

if [ "$op" = "+" ]; then
  echo "Result: $((num1 + num2))"
elif [ "$op" = "-" ]; then
  echo "Result: $((num1 - num2))"
else
  echo "Invalid operation"
fi
1st no.: 
8
2nd no.: 
4
+ or -
- 
Result: 4
