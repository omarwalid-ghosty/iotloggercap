Q1:

for files:
	r -> read file contents 
	w -> modify or write on file contents 
	x -> execute file as a program or script
for directories:
	r -> list directory contents 
	w -> modify in the content of the directory eihter by creating, deleting or renaming
	x -> enter the directory and access its files
Example:
	A directory with rwxr-x--- -> owner can do everything, group can list or enter but not modify, others have no access.
	
Q2:

permisions use numbers r = 4 , w = 2 , x = 1 and combining them gives permision for each class
for example: 770 = rwxrwx---
the umask set the permissions by subtracting form the system's default 
for example default: 770 and umask: 020 --> new file : 050

Q3:

the root user has unrestricted access to the system with special superuser id
the normal user has limited access and cannot perform administrative tasks
