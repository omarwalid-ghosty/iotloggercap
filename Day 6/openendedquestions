Q1:

Cron is a scheduler in Linux for automating
commands/scripts having time fields: minute, hour, day of month,
month, day of week.
	Example:
*/5 * * * * = every 5 minutes

Q2:

Prevents log files from growing without stop
Saves disk space
Automates compression and deletion of old logs

	Example:
/home/omar/iot_logger/logs/temperature.log {
    su omar omar
    size 1M
    rotate 5
    compress
    missingok
    notifempty
    copytruncate
}

Q3:

A Virtual Machine: acts like a full computer. It has its own OS but is slower and uses more resources.
A Container : only shares the hostâ€™s Linux kernel. It is lighter and faster.
Containers need the same type of kernel as the host. For example, if the host is Linux, the containers must also run Linux (but can be different versions like Ubuntu, Debian, or Alpine).

Q4:

Combining redirection + process monitoring: checking sensor logs and PIDs.
Combining users + permissions: securing project files.
Combining cron + logrotate : automation.

In real IoT systems: ensures devices can run
continuously, store data safely, recover from errors, and stay efficient in production
